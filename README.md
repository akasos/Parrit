# Parrit
So this application is an exact spin off of an already existing application called 'Parrit', which is a pair rotation management web app,
that pairs members on a team together for those teams that practice pair programming.

you can check it out at: http://parrit.cfapps.io/

The reason for my own version of this is because it contains alot of neat features in it such as user login, drag and drop, and an awesome
pairing algorithm which I thought would be pretty cool to try and replicate for my own learning and understanding purposes.
